# qoo-c

Quality of Outcome is a network performance metric. 
QoO scores are calculated by comparing application requirements to network measurements.
The network measurements are Quality Attenuation measurements taken using the procedure described in TR-452.1 from the Broadband Forum.

This tool can:

* Compute Quality Attenuation summaries from latency and packet loss measurements
* Compute Quality of Outcome scores

How to use:

1. Create a link_monitor and add latency and packet loss samples. Samples can be added in bulk or one-by-one.
2. Calculate QoO

Example use

I want session statistics at the end of a test:


I want periodic statistics without G, S and V decomposition:


I want periodic statistics with G, S and V decomposition:

    //Make the link monitor
    struct qed_link_monitor *link_monitor = qed_link_monitor_create_default();

    // Add the samples
    qed_link_monitor_add_sample(link_monitor, 60, 1, 0.2); //Packet size, timestamp, measured_delay

    // Make the QTA
    struct domos_QTA *offset_cdf = make_QTA();

    // Get an aggregate for the interval you care about
    struct qed_aggregated_samples *aggregate = create_qed_aggregate_for_interval(link_monitor, 60);

    // Calculate QoO
    double qoo = get_quality_of_outcome_from_aggregated_samples(aggregate, nr, offset_cdf);

    // Caculate RPM

    // Calculate average latency, jitter, 

    // Calculate AIM
