# qoo-c

Quality of Outcome is a network performance metric.
QoO scores are calculated by comparing application requirements to network measurements.
The network measurements are Quality Attenuation measurements as specified in [TR-452.1](https://www.broadband-forum.org/technical/download/TR-452.1.pdf) from the Broadband Forum, but excluding the computation of G, S, and V.

TR-452.1 can be found here: https://www.broadband-forum.org/technical/download/TR-452.1.pdf

This tool can:

* Compute Quality Attenuation summaries from latency and packet loss measurements
* Compute [Quality of Outcome](https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-olden-ippm-qoo-00.html) scores, and several other performance metrics such as [RPM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ippm-responsiveness/)

How to use:

1. Create a sqa_stats data structure and add latency and packet loss samples.
2. Calculate RPM, QoO, or any of the other quality metrics.

Example use (see tests/unit/simple_qoo_test.c)
---
    struct sqa_stats *stats = sqa_stats_create(); //SQA is short for Simple Quality Attenuation
    
    //Add sample(s)
    struct timespec measured_delay;
    measured_delay.tv_sec = 0;
    measured_delay.tv_nsec = 200 * 1000 * 1000; // 200ms
    sqa_stats_add_sample(stats, &measured_delay);
    
    //Compute statistics
    struct simple_NR_list *nr = create_network_requirement();
    double qoo = sqa_stats_get_qoo(stats, nr);
    double rpm = sqa_stats_get_rpm(stats);

    //Clean up
    free(nr);
    sqa_stats_destroy(stats);
