# qoo-c

Quality of Outcome is a network performance metric.
QoO scores are calculated by comparing application requirements to network measurements.
The network measurements are Quality Attenuation measurements taken using the procedure described in TR-452.1 from the Broadband Forum.

This tool can:

* Compute Quality Attenuation summaries from latency and packet loss measurements
* Compute Quality of Outcome scores

How to use:

1. Create a simple_qoo_statistics data structure and add latency and packet loss samples.
2. Calculate RPM, QoO, or any of the other quality metrics.

Example use
---
    struct simple_qoo_statistics *stats = simple_qoo_statistics_create();
    
    //Add sample(s)
    struct timespec measured_delay;
    measured_delay.tv_sec = 0;
    measured_delay.tv_nsec = 200 * 1000 * 1000; // 200ms
    simple_qoo_statistics_add_sample(stats, &measured_delay);
    
    //Compute statistics
    double rpm = simple_qoo_statistics_get_rpm(stats);

    //Clean up
    simple_qoo_statistics_destroy(stats);
